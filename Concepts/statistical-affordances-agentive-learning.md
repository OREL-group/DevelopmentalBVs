## How do Gibsonian statistical affordances shape an agent's internal model?     
(answers compiled by Gemini 3, trained on all lab papers from 2020-2025)       

Gibsonian statistical affordances shape an agent's internal model by providing a structural scaffolding of spatiotemporal information that the nervous system extracts through active perception,. Rather than being a passive recipient of data, the agent uses these statistically defined clusters of information to ground its internal representations in the physical dynamics of its environment.    

__1. Spatiotemporal Encoding and Scaffolding__
Internal models are shaped by the way affordances organize environmental information into interpretable patterns.      

• Poisson Distribution: Environmental stimuli are encountered as discrete spatiotemporal points that follow a Poisson arrival model, which the agent encodes into its internal communication channel.    

• Feature Scaffolding: Invariant features in the environment provide a "scaffolding" for the probability distribution characterization that forms the agent's internal model.    

• Information Moments: The agent identifies "information moments," which are measures of the local density of sensory information that represent rich objects or affordances within its internal representation.    

__2. Motion as an Informational Signal__      
In the Gibsonian paradigm, information is defined by motion rather than simple statistical diversity.     

• Interpretable Motion: The agent's internal model relies on detecting interpretable motion against a background, allowing it to separate meaningful signals from random Gaussian noise or stasis.     

• Visual Momentum: High visual momentum results from a continuity of action that reinforces the distribution of perceptual information, helping the agent extract and integrate structure over time.     

• Direct Perception: This active sensing shapes the internal representation through a feedback loop where the thermodynamics of movement both drive and constrain the information content the agent perceives.     

__3. Associative and Correlative Learning__         
Statistical affordances serve as the building blocks for higher-order cognitive functions.    

• Correlative Affordances: Phenomena that repeatedly co-occur are treated as correlative affordances, which act as a gateway to associative learning by helping the agent assess relative distances, sizes, and object properties.     

• Semantic Grounding: Because Gibsonian information (GI) does not rely solely on internal symbolic representations, it provides a mechanism for grounding semantic content in the spatiotemporally dependent context of affordances.      

• Generativity: The internal model can evolve its own parameters, such as temporal delay (τ), as an evolution equation that creates an adaptive distortion of sensory input, allowing the representation to change based on past experience.       

__4. Risks and Limitations__     
While statistical affordances provide structure, they can also introduce errors into the internal model.     

• Spurious Correlations: Clusters of information can sometimes form novel but "spurious" relationships, leading to sensory illusions or misclassifications within the internal model.     

• Information Aliasing: If there is a mismatch between the agent's sampling rate and the environment's complexity, the model may suffer from information aliasing, where it overcorrects or produces out-of-control responses to ambiguous stimuli.
