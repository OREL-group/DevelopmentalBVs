Developmental freedom is the capacity of an agent’s internal system to produce alternative network configurations and information processing pathways within the constraints of its physical architecture and existing plasticity. In the context of agentive learning, it is defined as the tendency for information and representations to take advantage of a stable underlying topology to produce adaptive behaviors once the physical growth phase is complete.    

__The Emergence of Developmental Freedom__       
In agents such as developmental Braitenberg Vehicles (dBVs), development (the anatomical construction of the body and network) and learning (the representational acquisition of information) are nominally independent. Developmental freedom emerges through the following process:     

• Substrate Stability: As the morphogenetic period (physical growth) ends, the agent's neuronal network topology becomes formalized and stable.    

• Pathway Exploration: Once the network stops reconfiguring its physical connections, developmental freedom allows information processing to find and explore new pathways along this fixed substrate.    

• Adaptive Output: This freedom enables an "adaptive output" to emerge from a phenotype that has become largely static in its neural and morphological structure.    

__The Role of the Critical Period__
The degree of developmental freedom an agent possesses is heavily influenced by the timing of its critical period—a window of enhanced sensitivity and plasticity.    

• Early Onset: If the critical period occurs early, the neural topology becomes constrained quickly, resulting in a high degree of developmental freedom because the agent has more time to explore and refine weights on a stable circuit.    

• Late Onset: If the critical period is delayed, the agent may develop more diverse and complex network topologies, but it often results in a lower degree of overall developmental freedom due to a slower transition to a stable behavioral suite.    

__Applications in Agentive Learning__
In agentive learning models, developmental freedom serves as the "glue" that allows for complex cognitive precursors to take root.   

• Associative Learning: Building simultaneous associations between multiple sensory streams (such as odor and taste) is considered the "essence" of developmental freedom.      
• Flexibility via Constraints: While developmental contingency locks the network into specific pathways over time, developmental freedom allows the system to remain flexible and robust within those established circuits.
• Neural Refinement: It allows for the refinement of behaviors and associations to emerge from shared experiences between individual agents.
