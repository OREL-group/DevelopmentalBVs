## What are the different types of information that enable agentive learning?

Agentive learning is enabled by a combination of innate instructions, direct environmental perception, and embodied feedback that allows an agent to construct and refine its internal model of the world. As we discussed regarding developmental freedom, these information streams are often processed by a stable neural substrate to produce adaptive behaviors.    

The primary types of information that enable this learning process are organized into the following categories:     

__1. Innate Information (Genomic Encodings)__    
Innate information serves as the "basement layer" or initial condition for a learning agent. It provides the baseline structure necessary for any subsequent acquisition of knowledge.

• Architectural Instructions: Encoded as binary strings on artificial chromosomes, this information defines the structure and function of the body, such as the placement of sensors and effectors.

• Instructional Priors: These are innate behavioral primitives, such as phototaxis (moving toward light), that guide early interactions before the agent has sufficient experience to learn more complex policies.     
• Transcriptive Information: A layer that allows for the expression of genetic instructions in an analogue fashion, balancing hard-coded data with the needs of a specific environmental context.

__2. Environmental Information (Gibsonian Information)__    
Unlike traditional data models, agentive learning often relies on Gibsonian Information (GI), where information is not just statistical diversity but the detection of interpretable motion against a background.

• Statistical Affordances: Environmental features that enable ease of behavior or computation, such as surfaces or handles.        

• Spatiotemporal Distribution: Information is encountered as a Poisson-distributed stream of discrete points, meaning it is irregular and depends on where the agent is and how it is moving.    

• Redundancy: High visual momentum and redundant information are crucial for internal representations, helping the agent extracting structure even from noisy backgrounds.     

__3. Embodied and Spatial Information__
The physical body of an agent acts as a pre-filter for information, a process known as morphological computation.

• Differential Perspectives: Information is sampled through a spatialized sensor array, allowing the agent to compare points in a differential manner and establish distinct frames of reference.     

• Spatial Context: Embodiment provides a "contextual fabric" for internal representations, where the relative position of sensors to the body's midline continuously updates concepts about the world.       

• Sensory Acuity: Genetic encodings for plasticity determine how finely an agent can tune its acquisition of information during critical periods.    

__4. Stigmergic and Externalized Information__    
Learning is also enabled by cognitive offloading, where information processing is distributed into the environment.

• Stigmergy: These are informational "traces" left in the environment by an action that stimulate subsequent actions by the same or other agents.    

• Social Affordances: Higher-level representations learned from observing how other agents interact with the surrounding world.     

• Environmental Landmarks: Using features in the environment as common reference points to coordinate complex collective behaviors.     

__5. Representational Information__
Meta-brain models categorize information based on its degree of complexity, distinguishing between two states:

• Representation-Free Information: Low-level sensory inputs and connectionist models that lack assumptions about the external world.    

• Representation-Rich Information: Symbolic or object-oriented models that account for causality, intentionality, and object properties.     

This hierarchy allows an agent to toggle between simple reactive processing and higher-order internal modeling as the environment demands.
